## Hi there 👋

Welcome! 👋 I’m a front-end engineer passionate about creating scalable, maintainable, and accessible user interfaces. This repository reflects my ongoing work in building reusable UI components and implementing design systems to bring consistency and efficiency to front-end development.

Design systems have become a key part of modern web development, helping teams ship faster without sacrificing quality. I’ve been focusing on how to build and structure component libraries that align with design tokens, support theming, and promote reusability across multiple projects or teams.

In this repo, you’ll find examples of atomic design patterns, styled components, and UI kits built using technologies like React, TypeScript, and CSS-in-JS. I'm also exploring accessibility best practices and responsive design techniques to ensure components are usable by everyone, everywhere.

My goal is to develop UI components that are modular, composable, and consistent, with a strong focus on developer experience. I’m learning how to document components effectively using tools like Storybook, and how to integrate design systems into larger applications with minimal friction.

Whether you're building from scratch or integrating with an existing design language, I hope the patterns and code in this repo help streamline your workflow. Each project is a step toward mastering the intersection of design and development—where functionality meets aesthetics.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out with feedback. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are at the heart of every strong design system.

Thanks for stopping by—here’s to building UIs that are as elegant under the hood as they are on the surface. 🎨⚙️📦
